    <h2>David Adeogun</h2>
    <h2>Oba Dafidi</h2>
    <p>Very close friends call me "Oba Dafidi", meaning "King David". I am married
    and I have three wonderful kids. I am from Nigeria but now live in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
    <p>I love learning as a lifestyle, and what gets me excited the most in life
    daily is when I discover new things. I am particularly fascinated with trending technologies 
    in space exploration, artificial intelligence and autonomous cars.</p>
    <p>I am pursuing a bachelors degree in Applied Technology at Brigham Young University Idaho
    with the plan of becoming a Software Engineer and much later on, an AI Engineer.</p>
    <p>If I am not watching a movie or having a spending time with my family, I will definitely
    be on my computer coding.</p>
    <p>I welcome getting to know all of my classmates. Thank you so much.</p>
    <p>Excited to be taking this class</p>
