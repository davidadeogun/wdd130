      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The homepage usually termed "Home" is the first web page that a visitor to the website will 
        see and interact with they visit the website. The homepage contains basic information about what
        the entire website is all about. It is like an introduction to what the website intends to accomplish.
        For example, a visitor to the site can easily differentiate a website that provides insurance services
        from a religious website. The homepage provides this information. The homepage also serves as a link to
        other pages of the website. It's like the main entrance door of a house that provides access to other
        rooms in the house. From the home page, you can move to any other page on the website. This homepage,
        contains some images. It has the hero image, which is more like a bold picture that covers a significant
        part of the homepage. One of the images is the hero image, while the other one is for one of the testimonials.
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
        <img src="hero_image.jpg" alt="image for homepage", width="500", height="300">>

        <br>
        

      </ul>
      <h3>Services</h3>
      <p>
        The second page on the homepage is a child page. A child page provides additional information
        that the homepage may not. It contains more detailed information regarding the services or products that a website
        offers. There can be many child pages of a website, with each containing specific information as it
        relates to that page. The second child page of this website is the "services" page. It contains
        the information of the services that the business offers. You can find all of the information for the clients
        to make decision on this page. The child page is for informational, transactional purposes. There is no limit
        to how many child pages that a website contains. 
        The images are for the banner image, and for the service offerings.

      <h3>Contact</h3>
      <p>
        The third page is another child page called "contact". Just like the second child page, this page contains
        information about the contact for the business. You can find more details about the contact inforamtion, which 
        you would not otherwise find on the homepage. Usually, this page contains the email address, phone number, office location
          or even a contact form for users to reach out to the business. The contact page is not usually transactional unlike
          other child pages. It is to provide detailed contact information.
        The images are for the map location of the office address and the other for the banner image on of the page.
